# Day 14 — Evaluation + Project Complete! 🎉

## 🎯 What is Evaluation?
Evaluation = testing your AI system
to measure how accurate it is!

Like a school exam:
→ Give AI questions
→ Check answers
→ Score the results
→ Document findings!

## 💡 What 90% Means
-Industry standard = 80-85%
-Our score = 90%!
-ABOVE industry standard! 🏆
-Real world AI systems rarely score above 85%!

## 🔍 What We Learned from Evaluation
Strength 1: RAG = Perfect 5/5!
→ All knowledge questions
answered correctly!
→ Documents were high quality!

Strength 2: Routing = 90%!
→ Router correctly classified
9 out of 10 questions!
→ Very reliable!

Improvement area:
→ Complex SQL queries fail sometimes
→ Need better SQL error handling
→ Future improvement! ✅
